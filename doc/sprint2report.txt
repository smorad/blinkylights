What things should we stop doing?
We should stop being late to some scrum meetings before class.

What things should we start doing?
- Make documents more accessible (SCRUM Board, Burnup Chart, Sprint Plan, etc.)
- We will start documenting early and often
- We need to establish regular team working hours in the Lab

What is working well that we should continue to do?
- Holding SCRUM meetings regularly, 3 times a week.
- Communicating every day on the facebook group forum.
- Sharing ideas that come up while we are working that will benefit the release of the product.
- Updating SCRUM Board and Burnup Chart in a timely manner, so that progress is more visible to all the team members while the sprint progresses.
