What things should we stop doing?
We should stop being late to some scrum meetings before class.

What things should we start doing?
- Make documents more accessible (SCRUM Board, Burnup Chart, Sprint Plan, etc.)
- We will start documenting early and often
- We need to establish regular team working hours in the Lab

What is working well that we should continue to do?
- Holding SCRUM meetings regularly, 3 times a week.
- Communicating every day on the facebook group forum.
- Sharing ideas that come up while we are working that will benefit the release of the product.
- Updating SCRUM Board and Burnup Chart in a timely manner, so that progress is more visible to all the team members while the sprint progresses.

Work completed:
- As a user I want the companion app to support a drawing canvas, so that I may use it to create media to display on the LED orb.



Work not completed:
- As a user I want the companion app to display scrollable text on the LED orb, so that the LED orb may be used to display messages.
- As a user I want to wirelessly control the LED orb with the companion application, so that I can display media on the LED orb easily.
