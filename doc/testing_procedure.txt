To test, we will do the following:

	Blackbox testing:
		Try and draw different objects
		Draw and erase and redraw, looking for visual artifacts

	Whitebox testing:
		See if it's possible to overflow the bluetooth buffer with a normal use case
		See if it's possible for bad data to enter the bluetooth buffer
