To test, we will do the following:
	
	System Testing:
		User Story 1:
			Preload a hardcoded smiley face into the data storage on the chip. Power on the orb and ensure the smiley face appears.

		User Story 2:
			Draw a smiley on the app, look at the binary data sent over serial and ensure the format is correct

		User Story 3:
			Pair the client bluetooth with the orb bluetooth, send a rainbow over to the orb and ensure it is visible.

		User Story 4:
			Draw on the app using each color, ensuring no crashes occur
		
		User Story 5: This user story was canned after we realized our LEDs don't have the required precision

		User Story 6: Type "Hello, World" into the application and ensure the orb is displaying "Hello, World"

		User Story 7: Log RPM data to a file and ensure that the actual RPM is within 5% of the target RPM

	Blackbox testing:
		Try and draw different objects
		Draw and erase and redraw, looking for visual artifacts

	Whitebox testing:
		See if it's possible to overflow the bluetooth buffer with a normal use case
		See if it's possible for bad data to enter the bluetooth buffer
